# Incident Response

- **Incident Response Steps**
  - Security Event
    - Event that compromises CIA
  - Security Incident Process
    - Process of handling security events
      - Preparation
        - Develop incident response plan
        - Establish incident response teams
        - Step tools and communication channels
      - Detection
        - Identifying potential threats
        - Network monitoring
        - IDS
        - Security Audits
      - Analysis
        - Once an incident is detected - analyze to understand its nature and scope
          - Determining type of attack
          - Systems affected
          - Data compromised
          - Attackers tactics and techniques
          - Informs subsequent steps
      - Containment
        - Limit scope of incident
        - Prevent further damage while maintaining critical systems
          - Isolating affected systems
          - Blocking malicious traffic
          - Temporarily shutting down services
      - Eradication
        - Eradicate the root cause of the incident
        - Removing malware, closing security gaps, patches, restoring systems
      - Recovery
        - Restore to normal operations
        - Systems are cleaned and secure
        - Monitoring for any signs of recurrence or fallout
      - Lessons learned
        - Post incident review
        - Improve incident response plan

- **Incident Response Training**
  - Prepare individuals and teams to respond to cybersecurity events
  - Tabletop exercises
    - Team members walk through various incident scenarios
  - Simulation
    - Create a realistic cyber incident environment
  - Root cause analysis
    - Process for determining the underlying reasons why a security incident occurred
  - Threat Hunting
    - Proactive approach to detecting and isolating advanced threats

- **Digital Forensics**
  - Methodologies and principles applied to the investigation of cyber incidents
  - Identification, collection, examination, and preservation of digital evidence
    - Legal hold
      - Evidence is preserved for legal or investigative purposes
    - Chain of custody
      - Documentation that records the custody, control and transfer of evidence
    - Acquisition
      - Collecting digital evidence
    - Reporting
      - Documenting the findings
    - E-Discovery
      - Process of identifying, collecting, and producing electronic data

- **Types of Logs**
  - Firewall logs
  - Applications logs
  - Endpoint logs
  - OS specific security logs
  - IPS/IDS logs
  - Network logs
  - Metadata
