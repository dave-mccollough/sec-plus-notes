# Alerting and Monitoring

- **Monitoring Resources**
  - Systems Monitoring
    - Health and performance of individual computing systems
    - Unusual or unauthorized changes in system configurations
    - Resource utilization
    - System uptime
    - Performance metrics

    - Security Implications
      - By monitoring the above elements organizations can detect potential security incidents like system compromise, unauthroized access

  - Appliations Monitoring
    - Performance and security of software applications
    - Application performance
    - User activity
    - Error logs
    - Transaction times
    - Unusual activity may indicate a security breach
      - Unexpected data access
      - Changes in user behavior
      - Anamolies in transaction volumes
    - Effective application monitoring can help identify bugs, performance bottlenecks, and potential security vulnerabilites

  - Infrastructure Monitoring
    - Network components
    - Data centers
    - Cloud services
    - Any other critcal infrastructure elements

    - Scope
      - Network traffic analysis
      - Monitoring health and status of routers, switches, firewalls, and other networking devices
      - Performance and security of data storage systems
      - Goals:
        - Ensure infrastructure integrity, availability, and performance
        - Identifying potential security threats

- **Monitoring Activities**
  - Log aggregation
    - Collecting and consolidating logs from various sources in the IT environment to a centralized location
      - Simplified analysis
      - Aids in detecting patterns or anomolies
      - Essential for conprehensive security monitoring
  - Alerting
    - Configuring IT systems to notify IT teams of potential security incidents
    - Minimize false positives
    - Provide actionable insisghts
    - Typically include thresholds to trigger alerts for specific conditions
  - Scanning
    - Security and vulnerability scans, network scans, and application scans
    - Helps identify vulnerabilites, misconfigurations, or other security weaknesses
  - Reporting
    - Detailed reports of the security status of an IT enviornment
  - Archiving
    - Securely storing historical security data (logs and incident reports) for future reference
    - Compliance
  - Alert response and remediation
    - Quarantine
      - Isolating affected systems or components to prevent the spread of a threat
    - Alert Tuning
      - Refining alering mechanisms to reduce false positives and ensure alerts are relevant tna actionable

- **Alerting and monitoring tools**
  - Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)
    - Suite of standards of automating the process of configuring and monitoring network devices for compliance with security policies
    - Used for vulnerability management, measurement and policy compliance
    - SCAP can automatically verify the installation of patches and check system configuration, chack for sofware flaws.
  - Benchmarks
    - Standarized set of best practices and configurations
    - Use of benchmarks help mitigate vulnerabilites and attacks
  - Agents vs Agentless
    - Software Agents
      - Installed on servers and devices - send data back to server for anaylysis
      - More detailed data
    - Agentless
      - Monitor devices without installing software
      - Uses existing protocls and services
      - Easier to deploy
      - Less comprehensive data
  - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
    - Real time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and hardware
      - Log management
      - Event correlation
      - Alerting
      - Reporting
  - Antivirus
    - Designed to detect, prevent and remove malware
    - Basic level of protection against common threats
  - Data Loss Protection (DLP)
    - Identify. monitor and protect data in use, in motion and at rest
    - Help sensitive data from being lost, misused or accessed by unauthorized users
  - Simple Network Management Protocol
    - Used for managing and monitoring network devices
    - SNMP traps are alerts sent by networking devices to a management station that an event or change in status has occured
  - Vulnerability scanners
    - Assess computers, networks, or applications for known vulnerabilities
    - Essential for identifiying weaknesses that could be exploited
