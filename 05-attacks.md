- **Bloatware**
- Unwanted software preinstalled on a device
- Not inherently malicious, but can negatively impact system performance
- Characteristics of bloatware
  - Pre-installed applications
  - Resource consumption
  - Difficult to remove
- Mitigation Strategies
  - Careful selection of devices or hardware partners
  - Bloatware removal tools
  - Disable unnecessary applications
  - Custom OS installation

- **DDoS**
- Distributed Denial of Service
- Type of malware that disrupts normal traffic of a server or service by overwhelming it with a flood of network traffic
- Multiple compromised computer systems are the source of the attack
- Network Based DDoS
  - Using multiple compromised systems to launch a single attack
  - Compromised systems form a network called a botnet
- SYN Floods
  - Type of DDoS attack that targets the TCP connection sequence

  - Monitoring

- **On-path Attack**
- Previously known as man in the middle attack
- Attacker positions themselves between two parties
- Session Hijacking

- Attack exploits scenarios where credentials are transmitted over the network
- Mitigation Strategies
  - Encryption
  - MFA
  - Strong password requirements/password policies
  - Monitoring

- **Privilege Escalation**
- Attacker gains elevated access to resources that are typically protected from an application or a user
- Attacker starts at a lower permission level and escalates their privileges
- Privilege escalation process typically involves:
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware or software
    - Software bugs
    - Misconfigurations
  - Bypassing Security Mechanisms
  - Social Engineering
  - Utilizing existing credentials
- Vertical Privilege Escalation
  - Attacker gains a higher level of privilege than they should have
  - Similar to a regular user getting admin access
- Horizontal Privilege Escalation
  - Attacker expanding their control across a network or system with the same level of privileges

- **Request Forgery**
- Attacker tricks the victims browser or application into performing unwanted actions on a trusted site where the victim is authenticated
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Attacker forces a logged in victims browser to send a forged request to a web application
  - Application processes request - unable to distinguish between fake and legitimate request
  - Mitigation Strategies
    - Implement anti-CSRF tokens in applications
    - Use custom headers and check 'Referer' header to validate requests
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  - Attacher forces a server to make a request to an internal service within an organization from a third-party service
  - Used to bypass firewalls, access sensitive data, conduct port scanning
  - Mitigation Strategies
    - Validate and sanitize user input
    - Apply principles of least privilege
    - Use firewalls and network segmentation to limit reach of requests from web facing servers

- **Directory Traversal**
- Attacker access files and directories stored outside the web root folder
- By manipulating variables that reference files or using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access files stored in the web server file system
- Mitigation Strategies
  - Ensure proper web server configuration

- **Indicators of Malicious Attacks**
- Account lockouts
- Concurrent session usage
  - Single account logged into multiple sessions
- Blocked content
- Impossible travel
  - Logins from geographically distant locations
- Unusual resource consumption
- Resource inaccessibility
  - Servers or resources being inaccessible
- Out of cycle logging - Logs generated outside of expected timeframes
