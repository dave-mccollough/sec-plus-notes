# Security Architecture

- **Cloud**
  - Cloud Characteristics
    - Shared Resources/shared responsibility
    - Metered utilization
    - Elasticity
    - High Availability
    - File Synchronization
  - Deployment modals
    - Public Cloud
    - Private Cloud
    - Community Cloud
    - Hybrid Cloud
  - Service modals
    - Software as a service (SaaS)
    - Platform as a service (PaaS)
    - Infrastructure as a service (PaaS)

- **Infrastructure as Code**
  - Hardware is managed with code
  - Version control
  - Terraform, etc

- **Serverless architecture**

- **Microservices**

- **Air Gapped**
  - Physically isolation
  - Devices disconnected from internet
  - Nothing can access system from internet

- **Software defined networking**
  - An approach to networking that uses software-based controllers or application programming interfaces (APIs) to communicate with underlying hardware infrastructure and direct traffic on a network.

- **On Premises**
  - Infrastructure is fully controlled and managed internally

- **Centralized vs Decentralized**
  - Centralized systems can enforce consistent security policies, but create single points of failure
  - Decentralized systems enhance resiliency but make security more challenging

- **Virtualization**
  - Create a virtual copy of a computer
  - Use to host multiple operating systems on one host machine
  - Malicious code rarely infects the host OS
  - Easier to make backups of virtual systems
  - Real time scalability

- **Containerization**
  - Containerization is a software deployment process that bundles an applicationâ€™s code with all the files and libraries it needs to run on any infrastructure

- **High Availability**
  - Minimize downtime
  - Redundancy
  - Failover mechanisms
  - Reliability and stability

- **IoT**
- **ICS**
  - Industrial Control Systems
    - Several types of systems used in industrial productions

- **RTOS - Real Time Operating System - Embedded systems**
  - High performance
  - Safety and security
  - Small footprint
  - Determinism
