# Securing IT Assets

- **Segmentation**
  - Splitting network into multiple segments (Subnets), each functioning as a separate network
  - Typically done with a virtual LAN
  - Enhances security, performance and manageability of the network

- **Isolation**
  - Completely segmenting different parts of a computer network, system, or application
  - Prevents unauthorized access and minimize the risk of contamination or malicious attacks
  - Used to contain security breaches to limit their impact on the broader network

- **Access Control**
  - Granting or denying specific requests to access specific information or systems
  - Controls access between users and objects
  - Users are identified and granted access/rights
  
- **Principles of least privilege**
  - Limiting access rights for users, accounts and resources to only resources required to perform their functions or tasks
  - Minimum levels of access or permissions for users to do their job
  - Applications support principles of least privilege by:
    - User access control
    - Administrative accounts
    - Software and processes

- **Access Control Lists**  
  - List used by routers and other network devices to authorize or deny network traffic to or from specific IP addresses based on a set of rules
  - Also used by file systems to control access to files and directories

- **Filesystem Permissions**
- Permissions associated with files and directories
- Determine who can read, write, and execute a file or directory 
- Catagories
  - Owner
  - Group
  - Others

- **Application allow list**
  - Permits only pre-approved applications to run on a system or network
  - Applications not on the list are disallowed from running
  - Opposite of blacklisting
    - Blocking applications 

- **Patching**
  - Applying updates to systems or software
  - Patches can fix vulnerabilities, bugs or add new features

- **Configuration Enforcement**
  - Configuring and maintaining hardware and software configurations according to security policies and standards
  - Configurations are actively managed and enforced

- **Decommissioning**
  - Formally removing an IT asset from operational use
  - Safely retiring assets to ensure no security vulnerabilities are introduced during the retirement process

- **Monitoring**
  - Tracking system performance
  - Detecting unusual activity
  - Identifying security breaches
  - Use IDP, SIEM and DLP

- **Hardening Techniques**
  - Encryption
  - Disabling ports and protocols
  - Endpoint protection
  - Host based firewall
  - Host intrusion protection system (HIPS)
  - Default password changes
  - Removal of unnecessary software
