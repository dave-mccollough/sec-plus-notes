# Vulnerability Management

- **Vulnerability Scans**
  - Automated tools to scan systems, networks and applications to identify known vulnerabilities
    - Unpatched software
    - Security misconfigurations
    - Security weaknesses
  - Regular scans help maintain an up to date security posture
  - First step in vulnerability management

- **Application Security Testing**
  - Static code analysis
    - Static application security testing (SAST)
    - Examining code to detect security flaws without executing the application
      - Code Reviews
        - Code injection
        - Buffer overflows
  - Dynamic Analysis
    - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
    - Testing application at runtime to identify security issues during runtime
      - Runtime errors
      - Memory leaks
  - Package Monitoring
    - Monitoring software libraries and packages for used in applications for known vulnerabilities
      - Keeping tracking of updates and patches for 3rd party libraries

- **Threat Feeds**
  - Open source intelligence (OSINT)    
    - Gathering data from publicly available sources to identify emerging threats
    - https://osintframework.com
  - Proprietary/3rd Party
    - Subscribing to specialized services that provide details on latest threats and vulnerabilities
    - More tailored and realtime information
  - Information Sharing Organizations
    - Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC)
    - Industry specific threat intelligence
    - Facilitates information sharing among members
  - Dark Web
    - Monitoring dark web forums to gather intelligence on new vulnerabilities, exploits and threat tactics

- **Penetration Testing**
  - Testing a computer system, network, or web application to find vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit
  - Performed using automated or manual technologies
    - Determine feasibility of a certain set of attack vectors
    - Identify high risk vulnerabilities
    - Identify vulnerabilities that may be impossible or difficult to detect
    - Assess business impact of successful attacks
    - Test ability of network defenders to detect and respond to attacks
    - Provide evidence to support business investments in security
  - Black Hat Test
    - Closed Test
    - Zero knowledge
    - Usually from external location
    - Outsider or hacker perspective
  - Grey box test
    - Limited information is provided
      - IP address, domain name, applications
      - Could be internal test
      - Insiders perspective
    - White box test
      - Full information is provided
      - Documentation
      - Called a crystal or open test
      - Sys admins perspective

- **Bug Bounty Program**
  - Encourages ethical hackers to report vulnerabilities in return for a reward

- **False positives vs False negatives**
  - False Positive
    - Occurs when a system incorrectly identifies a normal activity as a threat
  - False negative
    - Occurs when system fails to detect a real vulnerability or threat
    - Leaves sysem exposed to potential threats

- **CVE vs CVSS**
  - CVE
    - Common Vulnerability Enumeration
      - Database of publicly known vulnerabilities
      - Each vulnerability is given a unique identifier (CVE-ID) facilitating easy detection and reference
  - CVSS
    - Common vulnerability scoring system
      - Framework for rating severity of vulnerabilities
      - 0 to 10 rating based on various metrics - exploitable, impact and scope
      - Higher numbers indicate more severe vulnerabilities

- **Vulnerability Responses**
  - Vulnerability response and remediation are critical components of cybersecurity
    - Patching
    - Insurance
    - Segmentation
    - Compensating controls
    - Exceptions and exemptions
    - Rescanning
    - Verification
    - Reporting

- **Internal and External Assessments**
  - Internal
    - Audits, assessments, and procedures conducted within an organization by its own designated audit team
    - Self assessments
    - Compliance
  - External
    - Audits, assessments, and procedures conducted by teams outside the organization
